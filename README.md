# 3D-Island

This template provides a simple 3D island scene with a rotating camera. The scene is built using the Three.js library and the camera is controlled using the OrbitControls.js library.

You can run the project by using

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:8080/` and you can view the scene in your browser.
